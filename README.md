# Hackathon 

Task 🧟‍♂️💻
Step 1: Download the dataset from the link available above. 
Step 2: Perform proper analysis of the dataset and draw conclusions based on your analysis.
Step 3: Build a Machine Learning Model to predict output based on the input column.
Step 4: **Bonus (max weightage) Make sure to apply:
Proper outlier detection and treatment.
Feature Engineering
Hyperparameter Tuning
Step 5: Use appropriate evaluation metrics and compare all the models and write your observations i.e. why is one model better than the other?
Step 6: **Bonus (max weightage) Build a Linear Regression model by performing appropriate feature engineering.
